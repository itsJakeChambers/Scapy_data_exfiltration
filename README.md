# Scapy Project Presentation

### Step 1: Installing Wireshark
*Wireshark is a network packet capture and analysis tool. It allows us to visualize network exchanges during testing.*

### Step 2: Installing Scapy
*Scapy is a Python framework for manipulating network packet envelopes. It is used to construct, send, and analyze network packets.*

### Step 3: Testing with Text
*Before working with images, preliminary tests were conducted by sending and receiving text using Scapy to ensure the setup was working correctly.*

### Step 4: Disabling the Firewall and Pinging to Test Connectivity
*The firewall was disabled to eliminate potential obstacles. Then, pings were performed between machines to ensure basic connectivity.*

### Step 5: Launching the Sniffer and Pinging for a Test Phase
*A sniffer was used to listen to network traffic while pings were being sent. This helps verify packet capture.*

### Step 6: Splitting the File into Chunks
*A function was developed to split a file, such as an image, into manageable chunks ready to be sent over the network.*

### Step 7: Creating the Script
*A script was created using Scapy to send these image chunks to another location on the network.*

### Step 8: Testing Image Transmission via Script
*Image transmission tests were carried out using the created script, verifying the successful transmission of chunks.*

### Step 9: Receiver Side, Assembling Chunks to Read and Display the Image
*A script was developed on the receiver side to receive the image chunks, assemble them, and display the complete image.*

### Step 10: Script Testing and Bug Fixing
*Extensive tests were performed on the sending and receiving script, identifying and fixing any issues or bugs that might arise.*

### Step 11: Marketing Strategy Reflections
*A marketing strategy was developed to promote the tool, highlighting its features, ease of use, and advantages over existing solutions.*

#### This project combines technical aspects such as network packet manipulation, script development with Scapy, and broader considerations such as network connectivity and the commercialization of the developed tool.
